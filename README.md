# Data-Visualization
Data visualization is a powerful technique used to visually represent data in a meaningful and insightful way. Throughout my coursework in data visualization, I have gained expertise in using Python and R to create compelling visualizations that aid in data exploration, analysis, and communication.

## Dashboard
This project is an interactive stock market dashboard created using R, designed to provide insightful visualizations for five major assets: Amazon, Netflix, Google, Apple, and Microsoft. 
- The dashboard offers a user-friendly interface that enables users to explore and analyze stock market data for these prominent companies.
- Utilizing R libraries such as shiny, ggplot2, and dplyr, the dashboard features dynamic charts and graphs that update in real-time based on user inputs.
- Users can select different time ranges, compare asset performances, and gain valuable insights into stock trends and patterns.

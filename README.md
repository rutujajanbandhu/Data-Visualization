# Data-Visualization
Data visualization is a powerful technique used to visually represent data in a meaningful and insightful way. Throughout my coursework in data visualization, I have gained expertise in using Python and R to create compelling visualizations that aid in data exploration, analysis, and communication.

## Dashboard
This project is an interactive stock market dashboard created using R, designed to provide insightful visualizations for five major assets: Amazon, Netflix, Google, Apple, and Microsoft. 
- The dashboard offers a user-friendly interface that enables users to explore and analyze stock market data for these prominent companies.
- Utilizing R libraries such as shiny, ggplot2, and dplyr, the dashboard features dynamic charts and graphs that update in real-time based on user inputs.
- Users can select different time ranges, compare asset performances, and gain valuable insights into stock trends and patterns.

## Graphics for Thyroid Dataset
The thyroid dataset is visually explored using various graphical techniques in R to gain insights into the data distribution and relationships. 
A bar chart is employed to display categorical data such as thyroid condition categories, providing a clear comparison of frequencies or proportions among different classes.

Scatter plots are utilized to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables, such as age and thyroid hormone levels, allowing for the identification of potential correlations or patterns.

Violin plots complement box plots by displaying the data distribution as a kernel density estimate, providing a more detailed view of data distribution compared to box plots.
